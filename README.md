## Youtube Clone

I built a YouTube clone using React, TypeScript, and Vite. For handling dates and time formatting, I integrated Moment.js. To manage routing within the application, I utilized React Router. The project is styled with Tailwind CSS, enabling a responsive and modern design. This project was a great opportunity to strengthen my front-end development skills while working with popular libraries and frameworks.
